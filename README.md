# Convolutional Neural Network-Based Image Processing in Electron Micrographs

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image processing in electron micrographs. The project focuses on the semantic segmentation of Al-20%Zn alloy dendrite during a solidification experiment.

## Methodology

The U-Net architecture, a popular choice for semantic segmentation tasks, was used in this project. U-Net is particularly well-suited for biomedical image segmentation, and has been successfully applied to various other segmentation tasks as well.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 86%. This high level of performance was made possible by utilizing data augmentation and transfer learning techniques. Data augmentation helped increase the size and diversity of the training set, while transfer learning allowed the model to leverage pre-existing knowledge from other tasks, thereby improving its performance.

## Future Work

While the current results are promising, there is always room for improvement. Future work will focus on exploring other architectures and techniques to further improve the model's performance.
